Keeper of the Records

## how to start

First run `npm start` from the `front` folder in one terminal window. Then run `cargo run` from the `back/record_keeper` folder in a separate terminal window.

Then in a browser window, go to `localhost:8000` which will redirect you to `localhost:5173` which is the frontend.
